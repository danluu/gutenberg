# Impact of server-side stale persisted CRDT rejection

Date: 2026-05-06

This report estimates how much of
[`LIKELY_REAL_ISSUES_HANDOFF.md`](./LIKELY_REAL_ISSUES_HANDOFF.md) would be
mitigated by a robust version of WordPress/gutenberg#77890, "RTC: Reject stale
persisted CRDT documents".

The analyzed corpus is
[`likely-real-issues.jsonl`](./likely-real-issues.jsonl) from this handoff:

- Distinct likely-real issue rows: 279
- STATUS-count weighted real failures: 452
- Manifest base commit: `345baea61cd`
- PR #77890 draft head at analysis time: `bd511b424f1e7077a59fb7f61f2f24cbd3b3c7eb`

## Assumed mitigation scope

For this report, a "fixed and good" version of #77890 means:

- the server atomically rejects stale updates to post meta key
  `_crdt_document`;
- stale rejection uses a real compare-and-swap or equivalent atomic predicate,
  not only a read-then-write check;
- the REST save path returns a conflict, and the client refetches, merges the
  current persisted CRDT document, recomputes the persisted CRDT meta, and
  retries.

The mitigation is not assumed to add optimistic locking for `post_title`,
`post_content`, `excerpt`, or the whole REST post record. It is also not assumed
to fix live CRDT merge/reconciliation, table/Y.Array merge behavior,
reload/autosave title state, post-lock/revision flows, or `/wp-sync` transport
and storage failures.

That distinction matters because many rows are "stale" in a local/live-state
sense, not stale relative to the server's latest persisted `_crdt_document`.

## Best estimate

The best planning estimate is that this mitigation touches only a narrow slice
of the handoff.

| Outcome | Distinct rows | Fraction | STATUS-weighted | Weighted fraction |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Fully fixed | 1 / 279 | 0.36% | 1 / 452 | 0.22% |
| Partially mitigated | 2 / 279 | 0.72% | 2 / 452 | 0.44% |
| Unimpacted | 276 / 279 | 98.92% | 449 / 452 | 99.34% |

The one fully fixed row is medium confidence. Under a stricter interpretation
where only incoming stale request payloads count, it should be downgraded to
unimpacted or partial. Under a more generous interpretation that counts weak
CRDT-adjacent save-loop effects, the partial count could rise to roughly four
rows. Even that generous model leaves about 99% of weighted failures unfixed.

## Rows likely fixed or partially mitigated

| Row | STATUS count | Classification | Rationale |
| ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| 99 | 1 | Full, medium confidence | `rtc_save_response_clears_crdt_document_while_title_and_content_survive`. The trace evidence is narrow metadata loss: a save request carried a non-empty `_crdt_document`, the immediate REST response returned an empty `_crdt_document`, and title/content remained correct. A robust persisted-CRDT freshness guard should prevent this stale or empty CRDT-meta clobber. |
| 61 | 1 | Partial | `rtc_checkpoint_save_reload_partial_serialized_body_behind_visible_block_tree`. Stale `_crdt_document` snapshots are present, but the browser also serializes and persists only a stale/partial post body behind a fuller visible block tree. Rejecting stale CRDT meta helps one bad path but does not fix stale `post_content` serialization. |
| 90 | 1 | Partial, weak | `rtc_persisted_crdt_doc_ping_pong_save_loop`. Peers repeatedly save the same visible title/content with different `_crdt_document` metadata. Rejection/refetch may dampen server-side CRDT-meta ping-pong, but the remaining root cause appears to be dirty-state or noncanonical CRDT serialization churn. |

## Important near misses

These rows look related to persistence, but the proposed server-side mitigation
does not address the actual bad field or does not have a stale server-side
`_crdt_document` write to reject.

| Row | STATUS count | Why not counted as fixed |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 8 | 7 | Stale title/content are saved while `_crdt_document` has already advanced to the checkpoint state. A CRDT freshness check would likely accept the request. |
| 52 | 1 | Save response contains the checkpoint state, but later REST reads return stale title/content while `_crdt_document` is advanced. The failing field is canonical title/content state, not a stale CRDT-meta write. |
| 63 | 1 | Follow-up saves persist `content: ""` while `_crdt_document` remains populated. This is a stale full-record/content clobber, not proven stale CRDT meta. |
| 89 | 1 | Opening a fresh collaborative draft can persist foreign whole-record state. Because the fresh post has no meaningful prior `_crdt_document` base to compare against, a stale-CRDT CAS is not a reliable blocker. |
| 141 | 1 | Some reproductions have CRDT divergence, but at least one confirmation has matching CRDT while `content.raw` remains stale. This is at most partial under a broader interpretation. |
| 155 | 1 | Stale `post_content` is saved with a newer `_crdt_document`. The CRDT meta is not stale in the way the guard protects. |
| 156 | 1 | Stale title/content revert while the collaborative `_crdt_document` advances. The stale fields are outside the mitigation. |
| 187 | 3 | Save storm/stuck saving appears to come from local dirty-state and CRDT metadata churn, not from a clearly stale server-side `_crdt_document` overwrite. |
| 207 | 1 | The explicit save path either used old title/content or emitted no post save request in the realistic repro. A REST pre-insert guard cannot reject a request that is never sent. |
| 227 | 1 | `markEntityAsSaved()` changes serialized CRDT save metadata after a save, re-dirtying the entity. Server CAS does not canonicalize that local churn. |
| 243 | 1 | A second save reverts the title while keeping the newer body and current/newer CRDT state. The proposed mitigation does not lock `title`. |

## Denominator breakdown

The handoff is dominated by bug families outside persisted CRDT freshness.
The following buckets assign every manifest row once and sum to the manifest
totals of 279 rows and 452 weighted STATUS rows.

| Bucket | Rows | STATUS-weighted | Expected impact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Full fix candidate | 1 | 1 | Fixed if the mitigation blocks stale/empty `_crdt_document` clobbers, not only incoming stale request payloads. |
| Partial candidates | 2 | 2 | Some bad CRDT-meta writes are blocked, but independent bad title/content/body or dirty-state behavior remains. |
| Stale title/content/full-record save | 10 | 16 | Unimpacted. The stale fields are `title`, `content`, or the whole edited record, often paired with current/newer CRDT meta. |
| Empty/corrupt content or serialized markup | 32 | 69 | Unimpacted. The bad persisted field is `post_content` or block markup. |
| Title reload/autosave divergence | 24 | 45 | Unimpacted. Blocks and CRDT often already match while title state diverges. |
| Save-loop/dirty-state CRDT churn | 4 | 9 | Mostly unimpacted. Server rejection does not remove noncanonical local CRDT save metadata or repeated dirty-state scheduling. |
| `/wp-sync` OOM/transport/storage | 16 | 37 | Unimpacted. These are backend room history, polling, route, or update-delivery failures. |
| Table/Y.Array merge | 14 | 15 | Unimpacted. The failure is nested CRDT array merge behavior. |
| Revision/post-lock/code-editor/session | 8 | 8 | Unimpacted. These are different editor/session flows. |
| Live CRDT merge/stale-local/reconciliation | 168 | 250 | Unimpacted. The largest bucket: lost deletes, duplicated blocks, wrong moves, stale local snapshots, block identity smears, and nonconvergence before persistence freshness matters. |

## Sensitivity range

| Interpretation | Full | Partial | Unimpacted |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Strict incoming stale-CRDT request guard only | 0 | 2 | 277 |
| Best estimate | 1 | 2 | 276 |
| Broader CRDT-meta clobber and weak save-loop effects | 1 | 4 | 274 |
| Very generous CRDT-adjacent reading | 1 | about 8 | about 270 |

The strict and best-estimate models are the most defensible. The broader models
count rows where the fix may block a bad CRDT-meta write in some executions, but
the user-visible bug would still remain unless a separate save serialization,
title/content freshness, or dirty-state bug is fixed.

## Practical conclusion

The server-side mitigation is worth doing because it closes a real and dangerous
persistence race. It should not be expected to materially reduce the current
handoff backlog.

For planning purposes:

- expected fully fixed rows: 0-1;
- expected partially mitigated rows: 2, maybe 4 under a broader interpretation;
- expected unaffected rows: roughly 99% of the weighted handoff.

The next higher-leverage areas are live CRDT reconciliation, projection of live
collaborative state into `post_content`/`post_title` save payloads, title
reload/autosave state, and `/wp-sync` room-history storage limits.
